# Amazon-Data-Analysis

This dataset is a dense subset that contains products reviews and some metadata from Amazon sports and outdoors department, including 296,337 million reviews spanning from 2002 to July 2014. Because it is a toyset, such that each of the remaining users and items have 5 reviews each, the sports activity trendency analysis may not totally correct. However, the sentiment analysis should work fine in real world.
